# java-apps

## Description
This repository contains various Java apps that I've created over the years.

## Compile and run
All of the individual `.java` files can be compiled and run from a terminal:
```
> javac <insert-file-name>
> java <insert-file-name-without-extension>
```

For example:
```
> javac TicTacToe.java
> java TicTacToe
```

## Additional work
In addition to these Java apps, I have created other Java projects that utilize:
- sorting and searching
- vectors
- interfaces
- software development processes
- user-defined libraries
- exception handling
