# java-apps

## Description
This repository contains various Java apps that I've created over the years.

## Compile and run
All of the individual `.java` files can be compiled and run from a terminal:
```
> javac <insert-file-name> (ex: TicTacToe.java)
> java <insert-file-name-without-extension> (ex: TicTacToe)
```
